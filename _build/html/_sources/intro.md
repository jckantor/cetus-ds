# Data Science and its Applications

## Description

Data science applies core principles from mathematics, statistics, computer science and programming to the complex data generated by modern business and scientific operations. Data science provides tools to visualize and extract information from data, analyze operations, create models that predict future behavior, and ultimately provide new insights into complex systems. 

These notebooks provides a "hands-on" introduction to data science and selected applications. The audience for these notebooks will be curious about the subject, perhaps considering a data project of their own, or may be contemplating further study and work in this rapidly growing discipline. 

With guided study, these notebooks will show you how to get started in working with small to medium scale data sets, use tools from the Python libraries most widely used for data science, and introduce several key mathematical and statistical concepts needed to study data. Working though these notebooks will provide you with the skills needed to start on your own data projects, or continue your study of data science.

## Topics Covered

1. **Getting Started with Python.** 
    
    Python is one of the most important programming tools for data science. These notebooks are a crash course on getting started with Python, how to find and install the important libraries used for data science, and the most frequently used concepts for manipulating data in Python.

2. **Working with Data.** 

    Data comes in many forms, ranging from small tables that fit on a page of paper to the enormous data bases of the large e-commerce businesses. The notebooks present principles of *Tidy Data* for organizing small to medium sized data sets typical of many data science applications, the use of the *Pandas DateFrames* to read, manipulate, analyze and display data, and use of plotting libraries to create *visualization* of more complex data.

3. **Finding Information in Data.**

    The important relationship among variables is often hidden in repeated observations of key variables. The mathematics of linear algebra and statistics reveal those relationships to produce practical results such as movie, book, and product recommendation systems. These notebooks show how to create descriptive statistics for data sets, analyze *correlation* among variables, the problem of *lurking variables and Simpson's paradox*, and the technique of *Principal Component Analysis (PCA)* with applications to recommendation systems.

4. **Probability and Inference.**

    Data is often gathered from experiments to answer specific questions. For example, does product A work better than product B? Does a shipment of parts meet quality requirements? Is a process running correctly? To help answer questions like these,  this set of notebooks present an overview of statistical concepts of conditional probability, Bayes's Theorem, random variables and probability distributions, and hypothesis testing. The notebooks will show how politics, science and business use statistical concepts in controlled A/B testing experiments.

5. **Supervised Machine Learning.**

    Supervised machine learning is a collection of techniques for reducing large complex data sets to functions that map process inputs to process outputs. These notebooks use the popular `scikit-learn` package for machine learning to show how to fit models of increasing complexity to complex modeling problems. Using a 100 year history of weather data, the notebook show to identify features in the data that predict an ecological response, and how logistic regression can be used to predict the likelihood of flooding events.

6. **Working with Images.**

    Machine vision applications process large amounts of image data to identify features of interest for many engineering applications. These notebooks demonstrate use of the important popular OpenCV package to capture images from a camera, clean and prepare the images, segment the images to locate and report the positiaon of objects.

7. **Starting your own Data Science Project.**

    Having been introduced to the elements of data science, the next step is to identify a project of your own! This final collection of notebooks provides guidance on finding the data sources, programming libraries, books, journal articles and training that you need to pursue your data science goals.
